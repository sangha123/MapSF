(1) Create google maps api key
(2) Use one of the examples, insert the key and instantiate a map. Give the coordinates of San Francisco(SF) as the central co-ordinates of the map.
(3) Crime1.1.html has the map with markers representing the location of the crime and describing the crime.
(i) The crime data is downloaded from https://data.sfgov.org in JSON format. 
(4) Crime1.4.html provides an intensity map for crimes and the boundaries between different neighborhoods.Inorder to	get the neighborhood boundaries I downloaded the neighborhood data	in the form of a shapefile from	  https://data.sfgov.org/Geography/Planning-Neighborhoods/qc6m-r4ih.	The next step was to overlay the neighborhoods on the google map. I installed GSL, GDAL and QGIS and used ogr2ogr to convert the shape file into a kml file. Further I added an crime intensity heatmap on top of the neighborhoods. It is possible to zoom into each neighborhood and get an intensity map for it 

(4)In Crime1.3.html I want to provide crime statistics for each neighborhood. In order to do it first I separated the neighborhood shapefile into individual kml for each neighborhood (Open the QGIS GUI , go to Vector->Data Management->Split Vector Layers). Then I used ogr2ogr to convert the kml files into GeoJSON format. Next I read in the JSON file for each neighborhood and feed the latitude and longitude to the polygon function from Google maps. This produces polygons of each of the neighborhoods and it is possible to move the mouse over and get properties of the neighborhood using infowindow. In order to slice and dice the crime I use pandas and produce pir charts corresponding to each neighborhood.
